# Sharif AIC2021 - DZ Coffee Co Reinforcement Learning

This is our RL agent and the environment we created for AIC21 to train our RL agent.
*Unfourtantly* due to the low performance of the AIC21 server we were unable to train the agent and we're forced to abandon this code.
It still has a nice DD-DeepQL agent and some helpers to train the agent for future AICs.

For the state-base agent go to the `aic21-dz-if` repository.
